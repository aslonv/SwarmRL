## SwarmRL

A lightweight distributed framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning in C with Python bindings.

## Overview
SwarmRL is a distributed reinforcement learning framework designed for training multiple agents to coordinate and collaborate in shared environments. Built in C for performance-critical applications, it provides a simple API for researchers and engineers working on multi-agent systems.
Key Features

Multi-agent coordination - Train agents to work together using shared rewards and communication
Distributed training - Scale across multiple machines with master-worker architecture
Multiple RL algorithms - Includes Q-Learning, DQN, with extensible architecture for custom algorithms
Language flexibility - Native C implementation with Python bindings for research
Lightweight design - Minimal dependencies, suitable for embedded systems and edge devices
Real-time operation - Optimized for low-latency control applications


## Installation
## Prerequisites

C compiler (GCC 7+ or Clang 6+)
CMake 3.10+
POSIX-compliant operating system (Linux, macOS)
Python 3.7+ (optional, for Python bindings)


## Use Cases
SwarmRL is designed for applications requiring multiple agents to learn coordination strategies:

Robotics: Multi-robot coordination, swarm robotics
Traffic Management: Intelligent traffic light control, route optimization
Logistics: Warehouse automation, delivery optimization
Gaming: NPC coordination, tactical AI
Research: Multi-agent reinforcement learning experiments
